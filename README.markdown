# Passy's Raspbian ADSL Router

## Setup

I bought
a [DrayTek Vigor 130](http://www.draytek.co.uk/products/business/vigor-130)
which is a bridge-only ADSL2+/VDSL modem mostly used in business environments (I
like my cheap enterprise hardware) which is plugged into a normal ethernet
switch which also connects my Raspberry Pi 2B (provisioned by this repo) and
a [UniFiÂ® AP AC LITE](https://www.ubnt.com/unifi/unifi-ap-ac-lite/) for WiFi.

Nothing special or particularly exciting about this. It looks roughly like this:

```
+---------+     +---------+     +---------+
|         |     |         |     |         |
|  Modem  |     |  DHCP/  |     |  WiFi   |
|         |     |  PPP    |     |         |
+--------++     +----|----+     ++--------+
         |           |           |
         |           |           |
         |           |           |
      +--v-----------v-----------v---+
      |                              |
      |            Switch            |
      |                              |
      +------------------------------+
```

The nice thing about this is that I get a lot of control about all the
individual pieces and if something goes wrong I don't just have one big black
box that I'll have to hope will answer my prayers.

In particular, my previous modem had the annoying hard-coded behavior of
retrying five times on connection issues and then require a hard reset.

With my Raspberry Pi having this responsibility now, I get fine-grained
control over what it will do in this situation.

## Plan

Since this is a Rasperry Pi, I'd like to make some use of the GPIO ports. Maybe
show the number of devices on an LCD, or have an LED flash up if someone new
gets a lease. Now that it does PPP, I should definitely be able to show an LED
with the connection status.

Crazy long-term goal: build my own LTE fallback when the ADSL goes down?

## Preparing the SD Card

- [Get Raspbian Jessie Lite](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite_latest.torrent).
  I used `2016-03-18` for this. Also, don't be a jerk, and use the Torrent
  option.
- I use Lite because I don't even want to connect a monitor to the Pi and
  updating Xorg takes ages.
- Copy it onto an SD card. I'll leave it to you to figure out which device
  you're writing to, but keep in mind that this image is intended to partition
  the entire card, so don't specify a partition (i.e. `sdb` not `sdb1`):
  `dd bs=4M if=2016-03-18-raspbian-jessie.img of=/dev/sdb`

## Initial setup

- Plug the Pi in and connect it to a DHCP-enabled router via ethernet.
- My old DD-WRT had the `.lan` domain, so I could directly connect to
  `raspberrypi.lan`. Obviously, take care of conflicts if you have more than
  one. `nmap` is your friend.
- `ssh pi@raspberrypi.lan`, password is `raspberry`.
- This could potentially be part of the ansible script, but I prefer pushing the
  SSH key over manually to minimize the chance of locking myself out.
- `ssh pi@raspberrypi.lan "mkdir -p ~/.ssh/"; scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub pi@raspberrypi.lan:/home/pi/.ssh/authorized_keys`
- *Dont forget this one:* Resize your partition or you're gonna have a bad time.
  Raspbian only leaves you with a few hundred megabytes left, so run
  `sudo raspi-config` and select option 1: "Expand Filesystem".

## Ansible

Copy `playbook.yml.example` to `playbook.yml` and make the necessary adjustments,
notably add your premiumize.me credentials to it. Afterwards, you can run it
like:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook.yml
```

This assumes that the hostname in `hosts` can be resolved and you can log in
password-less via the `pi` user. It also expects the Pi to already have a
working internet connection.
